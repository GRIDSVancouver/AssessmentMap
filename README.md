# Vancouver Zoning Map - Work In Progress

The client side of a map of all Vancouver properties, using Mapbox GL JS. [Live version here](http://vanmap.reillywood.com).

Inspired by [Jens von Bergmann's much nicer and featureful Vancouver assessment map](https://mountainmath.ca/map/assessment), and I'm also in debt to Jens for sharing the cleaned-up open data underlying the map.

The project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.3.

## Build

Run `npm run-script build` to build the project, or `npm run-script serve` to serve it. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory, without hashes.

## Deploy to Netlify

`npm run-script netlify-deploy`

## Running unit tests

No unit tests yet.  When written, run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

No e2e tests yet. When written, run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
